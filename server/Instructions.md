Certainly! Here's a concise list of commands from starting your Flask app to testing it with `curl`:

1. **Navigating to Your Server Directory**:
   ```bash
   cd ~/server
   ```

2. **Starting the Flask App**:
   If you want to run it in the foreground (and keep the terminal occupied):
   ```bash
   python3 app2.py
   ```

   If you want to run it in the background right away:
   ```bash
   python3 app2.py &
   ```

3. **Running Flask in the Background (if it's already running in the foreground)**:
   Suspend the Flask process:
   ```bash
   CTRL+Z
   ```

   Send the suspended process to run in the background:
   ```bash
   bg
   ```

4. **Check Running Jobs**:
   If you need to see what jobs are running in the background:
   ```bash
   jobs
   ```

5. **Getting the IP Address of Your Server**:
   ```bash
   ip addr show | grep inet | awk '{ print $2; }' | sed 's/\/.*$//'
   ```

6. **Testing the Flask App with `curl`**:
   From another machine or terminal session, replace `<server_ip>` with the IP address from the previous step:
   ```bash
   curl http://<server_ip>:5005/
   ```

7. **Stopping the Flask App**:
   If you started Flask in the background, you'd first need to find its process ID and then kill it:
   ```bash
   ps aux | grep app2.py
   ```

   This will list processes related to `app2.py`. Find the process ID (usually a number at the beginning of the line). Let's say the process ID is `12345`, you'd stop the app using:
   ```bash
   kill 12345
   ```

This list provides a basic workflow to start, run, test, and stop your Flask application on your server. Adjustments may be needed depending on your specific environment or requirements.
